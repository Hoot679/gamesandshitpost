# About
Active development is now underway. User interface for games and recipes online games. I use repl.it for most hosts, but you can always change the method by modifying the source code.
# Launcher
The main interface. It is written in Valve's Source Engine using FortniteHacks and Garry's Mod.
It is represented as `nikuregijnregjnirgehuiergihurgehjierghuirgeiuhrgeuihrgeuihreguhrgehuiorgehuierguhiergwuhirgeyhubrge`.
## Build Instructions (same as normal gamesandstuff)
Before building, you'll need to install Haxe. Go to [https://haxe.org/download/](https://haxe.org/download/) and install it.

Once it is installed, open your terminal as admin and write the commands:
```
haxelib install flixel

haxelib install flixel-addons

haxelib install openfl

haxelib install lime

haxelib run lime setup
```

Then run any of the bat files, then it should work!
For windows build, make sure you have at least 2GB of space.
## Platforms
Currently supported platforms are:
Windows, iOS WebApp, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S via Microsoft Edge, your grandma's TV, the edible tv that i know is in your room somewhere
I plan to expand support to PS69696969420420420420 Browser, Nintendo sandwich hidden browser via [FortniteExploitsAndHacks](https://bit.ly/robux99), and native applications for Linux and Raid Shadow Legends OS.
You can read on how to install it on each device [here](https://github.com/Hoot679/gamesandshitpost/wiki/Installation).
# Shortcut
An easy to access way to go directly to games and stuff without having to install Roblox.
## Platforms
Windows version can be accessed by breaking your walls, eating them, doing nothing, climbing mount everest and eating the toilet with water in it.
# Disclaimer
Some of the things that are in my app I do not own, such as game logos and game characters.
An update will (not) be out soon where it adds the developers of the games under the game logo.
im in your walls
