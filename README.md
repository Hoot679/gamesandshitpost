# About
Games and Stuff is a frontend UI for launching games hosted online. I mainly use repl.it, but by editing the source code you can redirect to what ever.
# Launcher
The main interface. It is written in Haxe using OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.
## Platforms
Currently supported platforms are:
Windows, iOS WebApp, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S via Microsoft Edge and the Web.
I plan to expand support to PS5 Browser, Nintendo Switch hidden browser via [SwitchBru](https://switchbru.com/dns), and native applications for Linux and macOS.
# Shortcut
An easy to access way to go directly to games and stuff without having to install the entire launcher. It is written in html.
## Platforms
Windows only for now as it is an HTA Application.
