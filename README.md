## About
Games and Stuff is a frontend UI for launching games hosted online. I mainly use repl.it, but by editing the source code you can redirect to what ever.
## Platforms
Currently supported platforms are:
Windows, iOS WebApp, Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S via Microsoft Edge.
I plan to expand support to PS5 Browser, Nintendo Switch hidden browser via [SwitchBru](https://switchbru.com/dns), and native applications for Linux and macOS.
